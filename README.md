# 5th-sem-ML-Project
This project implements a stock price prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It utilizes historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it using MinMax scaling, and trains a deep learning model to predict future stock prices. The model is then evaluated by comparing predicted prices with actual prices.
